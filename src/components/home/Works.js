                    the time in the world and also noticed that our company
                    landing page was not that good. So I turned on my PC, opened
                    Figma, drafted some prototypes, opened VSCode and started
                    typing. The whole project was completed in less than a week,
                    and I think it was very well-crafted. I also added a small
                    animated area to demonstrate the &quot;To the moon&quot;

                    affecting me until now. I learnt to work with React here,
                    and was able to create a small dashboard to control the
